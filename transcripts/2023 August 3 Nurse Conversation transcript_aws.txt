All right. Go ahead, dad. Thank you. Ok. My grandfather Bergeron was brought
over here with his family as a baby. I am. There were like most immigrants were
for but uh hard working and they, it settled uh just outside of Waukesha, a
little crossroad town called Sales. There is just a dot On the map, it's not,
not a village. Uh How old they were farm workers basically. And my grandfather
went to work for neighbors or other people when he was 11 years old and was very
thrifty and saved his money and worked hard. And by the time who was a young
man, I don't know what, what Jack exactly. I had saved enough, but he could
purchase a, his own farm. Is that the article in the Sentinel? Yeah. Ok. That's,
and uh, I'm, I'm sure he had some help from his in-laws, the stark family. That
was my grandmother. Um, because uh is the farm he purchase was very near to
their farm and it just makes sense that but um, that side of the family would
help to purchase the farm because it was no small endeavor to purchase an 80
acre farm and it must have been, um, uh, uh, a small herd of cows and machinery
that went along with it. Um, but he was, my grandfather was not only hard
working. It was, he was, um, very, um, what choice say we would, we would call
him tight today. Thrifty. Yeah, he was thrifty tot. He didn't waste anything
with. Ok. Well, but, but he was an extremely hard worker. So, uh, he made a
fortunate purchase of, of, of his land. His 1st 80 acres w which was at that
time, three miles from the city of Waukesha. And eventually Waukesha grew enough
that it, it, um, it was absorbed into the subdivided into the city which of
course, made the land worth a lot. Did he, did he sell it in his lifetime? Did
he sell it then? Yeah. Yes. In his lifetime, he sold it and I remember I was old
enough then I was probably in, in college or something. Went on. He decided that
he, he was started to have a, yeah, some, uh, I won't say health problems, um,
pains and aches and, uh, couldn't, uh, do the farm work anymore. Um, my dad came
close to buying this. I wondered why your dad did not, but they never, my dad
was very cautious to a fault and wouldn't, I don't know why. Um, it was, I was
scared by the depression. My dad was a young man during the depression but he
wouldn't wouldn't take the leap and the risk. He didn't want the risk. Right.
Sign the mortgage. And so they can never get together on a, I'm surprised. And
now not for, I later values it, it seemed like a, I, I know, I, I wanna say a
small difference but, uh, something that should have, should have been
negotiated. How, any, how, uh, so the farm was, was sold to, to outsiders and I
can remem remember that. I was said probably in college at the time. 00, if it
had been passed in the family, if it had been passed down in the family to
Harold or you, it was probably worth a lot of money when it was just starting to
skyrocket at that time. So why wouldn't Harold risk that? I, I don't know. Well,
I know some of the reasons my dad and married Cynthia and uh uh they had two
young boys. The twins were born at that time and the, the farmhouse Sarah was
close. Um uh there were old fashioned, there was a, there's no running water in
our house. And uh so, and uh furthermore, she did not want to move 12 or 15
miles from Earth Lake where her home was to, to Waukesha where the farm was. And
uh so my dad actually ran the farm for a year or two and, and they moved there.
This is while I was in college, but they must have been just renting from my
grandfather because, um, that the last one long, more than one year or one
season. And, um, and, and my dad decided he couldn't, I couldn't, um, continue
to rent it like in, and his wife wasn't happy living there. And so they were,
they were be sold. But I'm sorry, I like to say that both, both my grandfathers,
um, raised, uh, uh, successful dairy herds. My grandfather's was, was eventually
sold at auction and it was just a small herd, but it was a good one. I am no. On
the other hand, the other part of the family, and they said that the operation
eventually has become quite large, a very big modern dairy and both grandfathers
was a dairy farm. You said both of them had a dairy farm, did milking and not
beef cattle. You're saying dairy, dairy. Ok. Do you know, do, have you been back
to the property? I know it's not a farm anymore. But where is it in Waukesha? On
the south? Yes, I've been back there and, and it is very hard to recognize
because uh it was on the hillside and the kind of bulldoze the the hills divided
into lots, but the old farmhouse is still there that I can recognize the
farmhouse is still there. No, the one I said my uh Cynthia, my stepmother did
more living, but it was better modernize the course. And so today is part of a
baby. Not I'm not a big about in that sense but part of a modern, um, house in a
suburb division that do you have to know the shape of the old house to realize
it's the old farmhouse that's been built on to? Wow. It must have been in pretty
good shape or they would have torn it down. It was sound. Hm. And did your
grandfather Ernest? So he worked for other farms first before he bought his
farm. He worked in other people's farms probably until he was 25 and maybe 30
years old. I don't know, ever stop to calculate how old they were to be when
they got married. But I'm not young. So he did not meet his wife. He met his
wife. Oh, she was from Germany as well. Stark Stark family. Her family had
emigrated like a whole generation earlier to start. Family was, it was fairly
well established in the Walker Store area. And one of, one of the funniest
stories I tell is that I said my, he, my grandfather water farm near where Stark
family, his in-laws near where they were. They were just down the road. And my
dad told the story is, well, that's my, my grandmother was the oldest child in
the start and the Stark family. And so her younger, her, her siblings, I walk
the walk to the country school which was not too far, a mile farther down the
road. I want my grandma when my dad was, was five years old, he wanted to go to
school and his, his uncle was still in grade school and, and would walk, walk
past on the way to school. And so, so the September, when my dad was five, he
decided that he wanted to go to school. So when his uncle walked past him to go
to school, he joined, my dad joined him there and, and um, obviously Rome, ok,
the rules were not so strict in those days, let them come. I bet the teacher had
to decide who, I mean, not that they were lined up to go to school. Probably
most, probably most kids or most families, they didn't even want their kids to
go. But, uh, and now my dad wanted to go to school and so he was, um, um, for
his age and so, um, I, I suppose he was five years old rather than six. His
birthday was in November. So he was, uh, on the young side and, um, but the
teacher let him stay in school. So he, he was a bit precocious. A bit ahead of
his. What was his uncle? That would be Ernest's brother? No, you said his uncle
was Roy Stark. Oh, his, his mom's brother? Oh, because they lived next door. I
knew him, as you said, he was the generation of, uh, uh, wasn't very distinct of
the kind of ran together. And, uh, my, my dad, uh, what the, what the so friends
of his, uh, Stark family, uncles and aunts or for his whole life? Really?
Because II, I knew most of them through what was Ernest's wife's name? It was
Stark. But what was her first name? May? No, that wasn't me. So Harold's mom.
No. Oh, why, why, why can't I snap that? My grandmother, Myrtle, Myrtle. Myrtle
Stark. Ok. Now, did Ernest and Myrtle then move to Florida? Are they the ones we
visited? Myrtle died, uh, fairly young, age, like 60 something. And he
remarried. Ah, and so he moved to Florida with his second wife. The Florida part
I remember, but it wasn't Myrtle, it was somebody else. Ok. What was her name?
Was Mabel? The same as my mother's a more common name than so, here's my
question. Here's my question about the Guan about Ernest Guan. I saw, um,
genealogy chart and Ernest's parents' name is good without the R and several of
Ernest's brothers and sisters. Gustav and Richard. And I don't remember. Fried
Frederick. They are good. Yes. But Ernest and one other sibling are good. Why
are, why did some of them put the r in their name? I know. Ok. This is what I
knew you. I've never heard that before. My dad never fully explain it to me. Ok.
But there was a, um, uh, take this spirit and the Gregorian family and my
grandfather and his brothers and sisters. And, um, II, I don't know, basically
what else was over. Um, I don't think just the spelling, I think the spelling
was more or less the outcome of it. One, um, my grandfather was the oldest. Oh,
is that right? Is he? He might be? But his father was. Goody Jan. I forgot his
name. Friedrich, I think Friedrich. Good. I may have it the other way. My grand
was the youngest and maybe, maybe the younger part of the family. But my, my
cousin Elmer, it was uh um I look up the um immigration papers in fact that go
he made me a photocopy of so the papers and in they are hand written and you
cannot tell whether there's an R there or not and it doesn't say good or John
not Jahn. No, it's Yon and you can't tell the difference between A Y and J so
nobody knows what it was in Germany. So then they get to America and Friedrich
Ernest dad spells it, Gudeyon Guan but then his son puts an R in it and II I
don't know the R got in there or why, why would they just suddenly say I like
were they, did they, do you think they had a falling out so that they didn't
want to be part of the family or they just decided to change their name? OK. I
think what we don't realize that it was how unimportant it was at that time
because documents just weren't different spellings to their names. OK, cause it,
however you copied it down. Clerk at the immigration office had much more to do
with the spelling of your name than you did. I had to laugh because not laugh.
But when I was looking at census information from 19 40 so you would have been
like eight or nine years old. And zi was what? 12? I saw a listing and it says
Newton, Newtin. So it's, however, the census worker decided to write it down age
eight, Newton. And then it said Zel Zelzie Zel, it's how they heard it. So that
was an official government document. But the names were wrong. So I guess you're
right that there wasn't any formalized way. You didn't have a social security
card or a birth certificate. Like you have a birth certificate though somewhere.
And I should see, it probably puts the R once Ernest started putting an R in, it
sounded like Harold put an R in and everyone after that. Well, that, but my dad
even pronounced it good. He did, he didn't pronounce the R very much really? I
did not know that good. And I, because that's what his father said, Gurian.
Well, maybe how come we started saying Guru Jan? Do you know it's hard for
people to say good or Jan? Maybe I'll just go to Gurian. It's easier for people
that stick in the air in there anytime you want. Maybe I will. Gurian. Oh, I
don't really like it but it's easier to say. Well, now I know there have been
all these names. Gurian and I thought they were unrelated to me all along.
They're quite related to us. They're very related to us. No, no, no, no. Your
cousin, whose dad was, your cousin? You said your cousin Elmer? What was his
dad? Wesley. Wesley's good area. That's in the, that's in the, so there's the r,
and the e I wonder if I just wondered if they fought the rest of their life or
if it was just a minor problem. Very strange. She reminds me, I, I would still
like to call my cousin Elmer sometime and, oh, Elmer is still alive. Yeah. Not
so easy in better health than I was. How old is he? He's two years younger. So,
he's 90. And where is he? Now? I can't think of the name of the town. It's just,
and in Wisconsin. No, no, in, in California. And I know, II, I know the
geographic location I can but it's, it's some little, so there's so many little
towns and California, all that. Um, the name wouldn't even mean anything but,
uh, your address book is here. Do you have his address and his phone number,
address and phone number and maybe even a, an email? Yeah. I don't know. When's
the last time you have talked with him? Oh, maybe two years ago. Oh, so you did
fairly recently, that kind of a relationship for last 10 years or so that every,
every year or every other year they, they were very good about sending, uh, uh
Christmas cards and kind of a Christmas newsletter along with it until, I don't
know they stopped or was that, er, and Sandy, is that who is Sandy still alive
too? She's still, she's younger. I remember four or five years younger than I do
remember. Sandy also in very good health for, there were last time we talked to
them but, er, was still working part time in his son's business when he was, oh,
he was approaching 80 maybe 78. Wow, that's impressive. Where, where, where
there was another 10 year old span when he was, I don't know if he was 88 but he
was up in his eighties, he was still driving and helping his son. His son had a,
uh, started a specialized business of program. What? Supplying, supplying parts
for? All right. Can't think of that. Specialized businesses. I'm trying to,
prescribed is, um, no, or can I describe the business? Some, not computers, but
come on in. Hello. Hi. Yeah. First time, first time I've seen dad and I was
eating in a while. You look fantastic. You look, you look better. I'm good at
deceiving people, missing people. Ok. So a day over 91. That's right. You don't
look a day over 91 maybe even 90. Are you down to this? Should I keep the water
in the juice? Ok. I'll put it out first. I, but I do wanna find out more about
Elmer. We'll try to call him Dad. He probably doesn't, he doesn't know about. I
bet you, do you think the phone number is current? She probably is the phone
number you have is, it's not too old out of date. Ok. Um, yeah, we'll call that
right now. I just sort of wanted to see, I got a call. Did you call? It was
probably Lisa, this, uh, Li, who is it this morning, Lisa? Because I, and yeah,
so what, what, what, um, is, yeah, we'll talk, let me get the tray out and, you
know, it's probably gonna wanna know all about the pain last night. And what,
and are you wanting to just schedule the Tylenol in the morning or do you feel
like twice a day? Three times? I'm really not very experienced. Yeah, I, I think
we're good. We're scheduled for the morning. Oops, the tray is gone. Is gone.
There used to be a car out. Ok. I can sure. Well, I can put on the order, you
know, 7 a.m. or I can, well, before the, shouldn't it, could it be overnight or
every six hours? Well, that's what I'm trying to find out what he, what he
wants. It can be. Yeah, preventative. Well, we had it scheduled and then you
said you did it fine. But now is your pain is getting, no, I say that your pain
is just changing. You know, we're trying to figure it out. Something happened
last week. Some days is there some days it's not, it has to do with what I do at
night and how I sleep and what that's, that's what causes the back pain. Right.
And, and so the earlier that morning when I need it, I need it like five a lot
in the morning or when I, when I first wake up, do you get up that early? And
that's usually around five? Ok. Dad, is this what was happening when you were in
one of the rehabs? Uw, rehab? You were having pain at night. Was that a pattern
there too? When you were in rehab, you would have pain in the middle of the
night. Was that the same pattern or different where you would have pain? And I
think that might have been different. Ok. I won't worry, I won't, never mind.
Don't, don't, don't worry. Ok. It was too long ago a couple weeks ago. However,
dad, you were saying that last night he stayed up till 1030 watching a game on
TV. And thought that brought on the pain because of the angle he was sitting,
we're gonna try to see where the bed is and the TV is. So he, we're thinking if
we move the bed a little back here, you can see without cranking the back.
That's one suggestion he was raped. Dad was thinking that that's why later and
then you said the person who put you in bed wasn't very good at adjusting you.
My back was never straightened out at night with a creak, be twisted and I'm not
very good at telling her what's the matter or what I need. It doesn't feel right
to me, but I don't know how to explain this, change the pillows or what. But I
know I felt like I was kind of cramp last night and then lo and behold the five
pain. So something in either of those two things caused. Well, here, um, for the
positioning, what one of the things that you can make sure and tell them is to
make sure that your shoulders, your hips and your feet are kind of in a line
because if they're not and your hips are pulled that way, that's gonna creak it.
The other thing is you have your rear end kind of close where the bend is
because if you're down too low, you're not gonna bend where you bend, you're
gonna bend like this. Does it matter how do you set it this way or not? Because
if he was even, yeah, I mean, if I guess if he was perfectly flat, it wouldn't
necessarily matter where he was this way because it would be perfectly. Do you
ever lay perfectly flat? I don't know. I can't see myself I don't, but your butt
right on the crease is one thing. Ok. And then just the line. So, is that
something that we should tell attic or you can, or if he's, if they're
positioning him and he's saying I'm not comfortable, those are just things that
can cue him in. But his dad gonna remember to say that or should I say that to
them? You know, I mean, I talked to them, we have another care conference
scheduled. I got the email today. I don't know. And so do you think, should we?
This is what I'm thinking? The Tylenol. Uh huh. I think we schedule the Tylenol
at bedtime and then again in the morning. So, yeah, bedtime they tend to come.
Yeah. Are you getting up, have you gotten up in the chair any good? Because
that's what alleviated. You're like a brand new guy. That's what alleviates the
pain. Dad pulled his call button because you knew that getting out of bed and
getting in the chair would help your back. Yeah, that's what I couldn't do it.
Three hours. Five oiw up with a, yeah, until they finally get the three hours.
Did they say why they weren't able to do it? Well, the right crew is not here.
630 is the change of shift. The person I'm telling at five in the morning is
just the night, eight or whatever. Right. And then, oh, she says I'll tell him
or something. About that. But why does she have to tell somebody? Because can
they use the higher lift in the middle of the night? That was what they would
need the higher lift again. So, I don't know either. I did talk to Betsy but I
did not know this detail. I thought they, I thought no one came for three hours.
That's not true. It came, but they couldn't move him until eight. So to me,
which I don't believe that is what will relieve the pain. Um, so it wasn't like
it was a question. He really said I need to get in my chair. So I will, I will
clarify. I didn't know this when I told you this morning, when you said that you
needed to get in the chair. Did you tell them, did you ask for Tylenol and did
that come? Ok. Ok. Yeah. And she just said you have to wait. Um, so that's a lot
of hours. Yeah, I'm just ok, clean up here. No, I don't know. I don't know what
the procedure to that Tylenol was. Well, and when I finally got Tylenol, it
didn't help that much. Right? Because you were already hurting. Yeah. Um, taking
up the Tylenol. Yeah, I, maybe we should do it three times, well, three times a
day you can do that. I mean, Tylenol is a pretty safe drug. So, if you, you
know, took a dose, even when you weren't hurting the world wouldn't end. No. I
know. But maybe I'm thinking we should take the regular, yeah, whatever reason
for them, generally against medicines when you don't need. Right. When you say
you want to get Tylenol every day, I probably said no. Yeah. Well, I think
that's normal but things are changing and you're not moving around as much. So,
it's very, well, that's what I was thinking. Eight hours. I was thinking maybe
like, eight at night, then it would be four in the morning and then like, noon
down, the four in the morning would be, but then if you're sleeping they're
gonna wake you up. Would you rather have like, 10 at night and six in the
morning? But he said by six he's already hurting. Oh, I was gonna say 10 at
night and six in the morning. But then that's six is already too late. But if
you take it two hours later then you do. You know, I know it's a trick, isn't
it? And that to have you waking up, we're six this morning. It would have been
too late. But, uh, most mornings it would be fine. You know, at six, I don't
know. Well, here's, we can schedule at like 10, 6 and two and then see if
scheduling it keeps you comfortable long enough because you'll have it at
bedtime and then you'll get it when you get up. My only fear about six is if
change of shift is at 630. That's a little sticky time. Did, did you say 630 is
change of shift? The change of shift is at 630. So, the half hour before change
of shift they're doing. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what it is. We have to
ask them if that works with that. But Betsy should still be here now or if not
Tina should be here. Yeah. I just don't know how late she works. Does she work?
6 to 2? I have no idea. Yeah, I was gonna put my stethoscope in your bag in my
bed. Oh, I've been with my time. But, yeah, you think about the times that work
for your schedule if you take the Tylenol too early at night, I'm afraid it'll
wear off overnight. You know, you want the Tylenol to last all night. But I
don't know if you really wanna be woken up at three in the morning to take
Tylenol. So, we're fine. Like, what, what time do you usually get up? Wake, wake
up and there is no regular time they bring in here around nine o'clock and they
tend to get me up sometime just before that. What, um, eight or 830. What do
you, what time are your other, uh, morning meds? Do you know your medications
here? No. Yeah. Yeah, I could see that my days run together. I know it's the
middle of August. They could add it to the morning meds and then go from there.
Um, well, the message that I got from whoever called that was that he wanted it
before the morning meds. So that's what I was trying to figure out. I think, um,
I, I wanna kind of leave it up to you if you want. We can do it every eight
hours. We could do it, um, with your morning meds or we could try to do it. I
know this morning, whoever was here and called me said that you were thinking
earlier than your regular morning meds. So, because I was hurting this morning.
Right. Right. We don't know. Well, I can ask Betsy, but I'm, I'm guessing not
before eight. Yeah. So that leaves that morning part. Right. But I'm also
thinking if you get him too early at night, then it wears off in the early
morning. So I'm going for later in the evening to get him through the whole
night. I mean, that's gonna put them out at midnight too. Oh, midnight till
eight. Yeah. Which is, oh, trying to get you not to wake up to get the meds. But
so that they don't have to wake you up to give you meds. They either have to
give you midnight and eight in the morning or 10 o'clock at night and six in the
morning at night and 46 or seven just makes me nervous because the change of
shift, I mean, I worked at the hospital for a lot of years and maybe four in the
morning is ok, 55 in the morning. If you don't mind being woken up to give
Tylenol at five in the morning, maybe you'd fall right back to sleep again. So,
or we could do it like, three times during the day. Oh, you're right. It doesn't
have to be always, it's eight hours. Mm. Mm. No. You know, we could do, like,
nine or 10 at night and then do eight in the morning, or we could just do it
twice a day and then you can have it twice more a day whenever you need it. Uh,
that's too, I'd say just try 34, just do three a day for now. So to keep the
ahead of the pain, I would say, ok, let me just think this through. If we get,
we're thinking you, it doesn't have to be exactly eight hours apart. It can be
three times a day spaced out like 82 and 88 o'clock in the morning, two o'clock
in the afternoon and then eight again, eight at night to tide you over till the
next morning or even an hour later. If you early in the morning as we, we'll try
as early as we can, I'll find out what time I'll find out from Betsy. Um, I just
get a little nervous around the six o'clock hour because that's right at the
change of shift time. No, Ok. All right. He's really want early morning. So I
think it's gonna be a trial here. Dad. You're gonna have to let people know
we're gonna try something and see if it works. And so we could do five in the
morning, one in the afternoon and nine at night. Yeah, that sounds good. Ok,
let's try. He said nine at night that'll tide you over through most of the night
and five in the morning, I'll start him up. Right. Right. Right. Nice. Ok. What
else? Fun. I, I, well, I just wanted to check on you because I got that call and
I wanted to make sure, you know, we do as much as we can to keep you as
comfortable as we can. Oh, I felt this morning it wasn't working system failed
this morning. We need to find out why they can't use the po lift. Right. I mean,
I can't imagine in the morning or caregiver in the entire building. Like, I
mean, you might have to track somebody down in this. She said there's always two
on this shift, but maybe they were busy with someone else. But, well, right. But
then why would he have to wait until 83 hours? Ok. Then you have to wait half an
hour but not breast because we don't know the answer yet. Dad, why you had to
wait so long. Um, you know, may know, dad, you were here earlier this week, I
think multiple times. So, you know that on Monday, dad, you were, you had the
day Monday where you were? Really? We don't know what that, do you have any idea
what I, I'm kind of, the blood pressure is low. He's so that's a good sign. Good
blood pressure. No, I mean, it's maybe I, you know, just, your body is slowing
down and you gotta rest when it tells you to rest. Like I was carrying in the
girls like this could be change or this could be a bad day. I'm just gonna
change it. I don't like how that's hanging off open. Yeah, I'm just gonna put a
different. I don't like how that's hanging off. That's the cutting head. Yeah.
Mhm Speaking of bandages, I'm gonna share, do you want me to go on this side
where you can hear me? Now, I was gonna share what we were talking about about
wound care. Maybe you know the answer Deb but and originally dad's order from
the hospital was saying, you know, wound care needed to be done every day and
that's why we got it switched every other day and we understand that. So the
question is, oh, it's nasty is well wound care but like uh is the progression of
the wounds that he will eventually need wound care every day? Do we know
potentially? Because what are, what's our goal? It's not healing necessarily?
It's just maintaining. Um So, so wait, let me just not wrinkle it because it
stays, these can stay on up to seven days. Oh, that's nice. That's moisturizing.
Unless it gets loosey goosey. Yeah. So, we were just trying to figure out what
the future looks like with wound here and if it's, uh, the way that the future
looks is I assess it every time and if I feel like, oh, he's gonna need it
tomorrow, then we do it tomorrow. It depends on drainage and like, I've already
changed the kind of dressings that we're using. Ok. So we're just as far as how
often the wound care does right now, we're doing it three times a week and that
has worked adequately. And she was asking as things change with the wounds. Um,
what happens? And I told her basically, we change as it needs to change. If you
need it every day, you get it every day, if you need it twice a week because
things dry up, we do it twice a week. So that's what we are just talking about.
So it becomes more frequent if they start to weep, if they start to feel if the
dressing isn't, if it gets saturated in between. Oh, we might need to do it a
little more frequently or do a different kind of bandage. Is that a comfort
issue or just sanitation? And just so we're not really preventing infection.
We're trying it for you. No, it's just um, yes, infection prevention. I mean.
Right. We're not doing like we're not medically trying to prevent infection, but
we're also not trying to inspire infection. So it's prevent, it's keeping
infection at bay, you know, and just keeping you overall skin, you know, clean
and dry. Our goal might not be to heal that, but our goal is also not to worsen
that it's gonna get worse. But we don't need to expedite the process because you
were saying kind of to me that wound care was secondary. You weren't so worried
about those. You're worried about pain, which I totally understand that would be
my priority for you too. Is the pain, the pain we need to make sure and get that
under control. But I also wanted to understand why the the option of having
daily wound care we weren't clear on if it's every other day. Why do we need
every day? Yeah. The so the option for every day is still there in the future.
We might. Yeah, or in the immediate, the reason I'm I was here multiple more
times this week was not necessarily the wounds. It was because he was so, so
different on Monday, I mean night and day different from today. I know and
happy. So basically the long story short is I base the amount of time I'm here
on how you're doing. And if you have any changes, I come more and if you stay
stable and good, I come less. And so the more you see me.
